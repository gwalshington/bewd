#Rewsly

###App Description

The City Times needs an app and has hired BEWD students to build it. They want to enter the 21st century and move their print newspaper online.

You will build Rewsly during lesson 11 & 12.

####Time: 60 min

Here are the features needed by next class.

For now City times is only interested in linking to other news sources instead of writing their own news.

*	The front page welcomes visitors "Welcome to Rewsly" and list all titles in the stories table.
*	Visitors can view a story's upvotes, category and link to more details by clicking on the title from the front page.
*	Visitors can search for a specific story by title and category from the front page.
*	Visitors can add stories to the database if all fields are present.
	*	Prevent visitors from saving a record if it has errors.


We've supplied you with [story seeds](story_seeds.rb).

__Bonus__

*	Only display stories with 4 or more upvotes on the front page.
*	Only display stories created today on the front page.

Remember, Google is your friend!

Happy coding :)
